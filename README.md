# 🚀 Agents & Tasks Manager

A full-stack web application designed to manage agents and distribute tasks efficiently using automated assignment logic. The system enables administrators to manage agents, upload task files, and monitor workflow, while agents can securely access only their assigned tasks through a role-based dashboard.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Agents & Tasks Manager is built using the MERN stack and focuses on solving task allocation and monitoring problems in team-based environments. The application allows administrators to upload tasks in bulk through CSV or Excel files and automatically distributes them among active agents using a balanced distribution algorithm.  

The system ensures secure authentication, clean separation between admin and agent roles, and controlled access to data through protected APIs.

## 🔐 How To Login

Default Super Admin Credentials

```
Email: superadmin@gmail.com
Password: Admin@123
```
Admin can:

Create agents

Upload tasks

Manage admins

Monitor task distribution

Agents can login using credentials created by admin and can access only their own dashboard.

---

## 🧠 Task Distribution Logic

Tasks are distributed using a **balanced round-robin algorithm**:

- Tasks divided equally among active agents
- Remaining tasks assigned sequentially
- When an agent is deactivated:
  - Remaining tasks automatically redistributed
  - Task history preserved

Example:

25 Tasks + 5 Agents
→ Each agent gets 5 tasks

---

## 🔐 Authentication & Security

- JWT-based authentication
- Role-based authorization
- Protected API routes
- Admin-only operations secured
- Agents cannot access other agents’ data
- Super Admin deletion restricted

---

## 📦 File Upload Format

* CSV / XLSX must contain headers:

* FirstName, Phone, Notes

Example:

John,9876543210,Follow up with customer
Mary,9876543211,Schedule product demo
